        HttpClient resource deallocation: When an instance CloseableHttpClient is no longer needed and is about to go out of scope the connection manager associated with it must be shut down by calling the CloseableHttpClient#close() method.
        CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault();
        try {
            //do something
        } finally {
            httpclient.close();
